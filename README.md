# Data-Engineering-Project---Yelp-Reviews-Analytics-using-AWS

In this project, I will explore insights coming out from the Yelp Dataset. In this project, I have 2 goals.
1. To provide real use case for Data Engineering (in this case, analytics)
2. Practice on a cloud service provider (AWS in this case)

## Data Used
The Data comes from the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), which contains about 6 millions records of business reviews across US and Canada.
